## Abalone Classification for CS 5800

Final Project by Katie Wolf and Joe Kass


These files can be used by downloading the abalone data (available in the data folder) and downloading the three implementable .py files:

- bayeslearning.py

- featureselection.py

- featureselectionwithsexboolean.py

- tree.py


The data and the .py files should be in the same directory. 

bayeslearning.py is our initial implementation. 

featureselection.py expands upon the initial implementation through the use of feature selection.

featureselectionwithsexboolean.py adds in sex as a classifying feature.

tree.py is our implementation of the SciKitLearn decesion tree.
